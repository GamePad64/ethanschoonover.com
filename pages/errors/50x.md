Something Has Gone Horribly Wrong
=================================

You press your ear to the glowing display and hear a distinct "click" followed by the
mechanical whine of gears spinning. The sound of gears meshing at high speed
suddenly increases in pitch and you hear a crunching, chattering noise followed
by the smell of hot bearing grease and ozone.

Clearly something has failed.

You carefully pry back the glass of the of the display unit, revealing an array of glowing glass tubes. Carefully removing each one and setting them aside for later reinsertion, you see the back of the monitor crowded with small motors and a clockwork array of gears. There is a label pasted to one side of the unit's interior cabinet:

"Frobozz Magic Picture Company"

Next to it is a small squeezable tube affixed with brittle, yellowed celophane
tape to the cabinet. You pull the tape and tube off with little effort, bits of
tape breaking away. Turning over the tube you see the words "Emergency Gunk"
printed in heavy red letters, with "single use" in smaller type below.

What do you want to do next?
